The app uses iOS 26 Liquid Glass on the root `TabView` (iPhone) and `NavigationSplitView` sidebar (iPad). Users must sign in with Google or Apple; a 6-page onboarding runs once after first sign-in (welcome → AI-powered → privacy → stay-connected → choose-topics → get-started).

## Full feature list

- **Personalized For You** — on-device topic extraction from reading history surfaces a recommended-articles carousel on Home; opt-in/out and topic controls via For You Settings.
- **Article Summarization** — on-device summaries via Gemma 3 1B (**Premium**).

## Premium

StoreKit 2. Two AI features require a subscription: **AI Daily Digest** and **Article Summarization**. Non-premium users see `PremiumGateView` on Feed or a native StoreKit paywall sheet when tapping the summarize button. The premium-gated set is defined by the `PremiumFeature` enum (`dailyDigest`, `articleSummarization`).
